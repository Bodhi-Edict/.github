## Ira Project

This is the repository for the Ira Project. The Ira Project is an education technology project that aims to create an AI study buddy that users can teach concepts. The project aims to leverage reciprocal teaching and help users identify gaps in their knowledge. This project contains three repositories :-

1. Bushwhack - This repository contains all the web application code built on NextJS
2. LastWord - This repository primarily serves as a project management repository. It contains folders for epics and outlines the work currently in progress in the project.
3. Shukuchi - This repository contains the AI testing and fine tuning experiments. For access to this repository please reach out to the owners of the project.

Though we one day hope to find commercial viability for this project we have attempted to open source as much of the project as is possible and document our experiments so others can learn from them.
